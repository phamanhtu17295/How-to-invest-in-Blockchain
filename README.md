## ***What do I have for you ?***

This is my long-term research plan to be a Crypto Analyst through real-life problem and research material from books, industry leaders, online course and top-ranked course.

My main goal was to find an approach to studying block-chain that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it’s the top-down and results-first approach designed for Financial Engineers.

In investing, there are two way for you to get your alpha (return) , you doing deep research or you processing the data you have faster. I choose the former and I want all of you to be a part of my journey.

Please, feel free to make any contributions and feedback. 

## Why use it?
I'm following this plan to finding the hidden Gem in Crypto Market. I've been study and working in Finance Industry since 2013. I have a Finance/Investment Banking degree, not a Financial Engineering degree. I have an itty-bitty amount of basic knowledge about: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Probability & Statistics from university.

I think the best way for investing-learning methodology is something like  ['practice — learning — practice'](https://www.google.com/search?q=Outliers%3A+The+Story+of+Success+summary&rlz=1C1VDKB_enVN943VN943&oq=Outliers%3A+The+Story+of+Success+summary&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1627j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), that means where people first come to the market with some blockchain projects with problems and solutions (practice) to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology. After practicing with some elementary experiences, they can go into the market and study the underlying theory, which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems. Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences, and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly.

Investing is a life study plan. I am gonna update it when I have updated/trending information. Collaboration/ Team-Building is welcome.
